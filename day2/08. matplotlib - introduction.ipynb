    "If you are using Matplotlib from within a script, the function ``plt.show()`` is your friend.\n",
    "``plt.show()`` starts an event loop, looks for all currently active figure objects, and opens one or more interactive windows that display your figure or figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, you may have a file called *myplot.py* containing the following:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# ------- file: myplot.py ------\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``plt.show()`` command does a lot under the hood, as it must interact with your system's interactive graphical backend.\n",
    "The details of this operation can vary greatly from system to system and even installation to installation, but matplotlib does its best to hide all these details from you.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to be aware of: the ``plt.show()`` command should be used *only once* per Python session, and is most often seen at the very end of the script.\n",
    "Multiple ``show()`` commands can lead to unpredictable backend-dependent behavior, and should mostly be avoided."
