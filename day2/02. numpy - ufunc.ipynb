    "\n",
    "Computation on NumPy arrays can be very fast, or it can be very slow.\n",
    "The key to making it fast is to use *vectorized* operations, generally implemented through NumPy's *universal functions* (ufuncs).\n",
    "This section motivates the need for NumPy's ufuncs, which can be used to make repeated calculations on array elements much more efficient.\n",

    "## The Slowness of Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's default implementation (known as CPython) does some operations very slowly.\n",
    "This is in part due to the dynamic, interpreted nature of the language: the fact that types are flexible, so that sequences of operations cannot be compiled down to efficient machine code as in languages like C and Fortran.\n",
    "Recently there have been various attempts to address this weakness: well-known examples are the [PyPy](http://pypy.org/) project, a just-in-time compiled implementation of Python; the [Cython](http://cython.org) project, which converts Python code to compilable C code; and the [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) project, which converts snippets of Python code to fast LLVM bytecode.\n",
    "Each of these has its strengths and weaknesses, but it is safe to say that none of the three approaches has yet surpassed the reach and popularity of the standard CPython engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relative sluggishness of Python generally manifests itself in situations where many small operations are being repeated – for instance looping over arrays to operate on each element."

    "This can be accomplished by simply performing an operation on the array, which will then be applied to each element.\n",
